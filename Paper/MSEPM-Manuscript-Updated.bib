  abstract = "Reproductive factors have been linked to both breast cancer and
              DNA methylation, suggesting methylation as an important mechanism
              by which reproductive factors impact on disease risk. However,
              few studies have investigated the link between reproductive
              factors and DNA methylation in humans. Genome-wide methylation in
              peripheral blood lymphocytes of 376 healthy women from the
              prospective EPIC study was investigated using LUminometric
              Methylation Assay (LUMA). Also, methylation of 458877 CpG sites
              was additionally investigated in an independent group of 332
              participants of the EPIC-Italy sub-cohort, using the Infinium
              HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. Multivariate logistic regression
              and linear models were used to investigate the association
              between reproductive risk factors and genome wide and
              CpG-specific DNA methylation, respectively. Menarcheal age was
              inversely associated with global DNA methylation as measured with
              LUMA. For each yearly increase in age at menarche, the risk of
              having genome wide methylation below median level was increased
              by 32\% (OR:1.32, 95\%CI:1.14-1.53). When age at menarche was
              treated as a categorical variable, there was an inverse
              dose-response relationship with LUMA methylation levels (OR(12-14
              vs. $\leq$11 yrs):1.78, 95\%CI:1.01-3.17 and OR($\geq$15 vs.
              $\leq$11 yrs):4.59, 95\%CI:2.04-10.33; P for trend<0.0001).
              However, average levels of global methylation as measured by the
              Illumina technology were not significantly associated with
              menarcheal age. In locus by locus comparative analyses, only one
              CpG site had significantly different methylation depending on the
              menarcheal age category examined, but this finding was not
              replicated by pyrosequencing in an independent data set. This
              study suggests a link between age at menarche and genome wide DNA
              methylation, and the difference in results between the two arrays
              suggests that repetitive element methylation has a role in the
              association. Epigenetic changes may be modulated by menarcheal
              age, or the association may be a mirror of other important
              changes in early life that have a detectable effect on both
              methylation levels and menarcheal age.",

  abstract = "CONTEXT: ``Accelerated aging,'' assessed by adult DNA
              methylation, predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adolescent
              accelerated aging might predict CVD earlier. We investigated
              whether epigenetic age acceleration (assessed age, 17 years) was
              associated with adiposity/CVD risk measured (ages 17, 20, and 22
              years) and projected CVD by middle age. DESIGN: DNA methylation
              measured in peripheral blood provided two estimates of epigenetic
              age acceleration: intrinsic (IEAA; preserved across cell types)
              and extrinsic (EEAA; dependent on cell admixture and methylation
              levels within each cell type). Adiposity was assessed by
              anthropometry, ultrasound, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (ages 17, 20, and 22 years). CVD risk factors [lipids,
              homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
              blood pressure, inflammatory markers] were assessed at age 17
              years. CVD development by age 47 years was calculated by
              Framingham algorithms. Results are presented as regression
              coefficients per 5-year epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA/EEAA)
              for adiposity, CVD risk factors, and CVD development. RESULTS: In
              995 participants (49.6\% female; age, 17.3 $\pm$ 0.6 years), EEAA
              (per 5 years) was associated with increased body mass index (BMI)
              of 2.4\% (95\% CI, 1.2\% to 3.6\%) and 2.4\% (0.8\% to 3.9\%) at
              17 and 22 years, respectively. EEAA was associated with increases
              of 23\% (3\% to 33\%) in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
              10\% (4\% to 17\%) in interferon-$\gamma$-inducible protein of 10
              kDa, and 4\% (2\% to 6\%) in soluble TNF receptor 2, adjusted for
              BMI and HOMA-IR. EEAA (per 5 years) results in a 4\% increase in
              hard endpoints of CVD by 47 years of age and a 3\% increase,
              after adjustment for conventional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:
              Accelerated epigenetic age in adolescence was associated with
              inflammation, BMI measured 5 years later, and probability of
              middle age CVD. Irrespective of whether this is cause or effect,
              assessing epigenetic age might refine disease prediction.",

              methylomes of several hundred people in the Invecchiare in
              Chianti study to identify DNA sites in which percent methylation
              was systematically different with age. Then, we tested the
              hypothesis that changes of percent methylation in the same DNA
              sites occur longitudinally for the same DNA sites in the same
              subjects. We identified six differentially methylated regions in

              relationship with aging, noting that the genes appear to regulate
              metabolism or cell type specificity. The nature of transcription

              methylated regions suggest that these age-associated methylation
              changes reflect modulation of two biological mechanisms: the

              trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27, and the transcriptional

              basis of sex differences, we evaluated sex-biased gene regulation
              by constructing sample-specific gene regulatory networks in 29
              human healthy tissues using 8,279 whole-genome expression
              profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We
              find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue.
              Even though most transcription factors (TFs) are not
              differentially expressed between males and females, many have
              sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes
              that are differentially targeted by TFs between the sexes are
              enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain
              tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson's disease
              and Alzheimer's disease are targeted by different sets of TFs in
              each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of
              TFs that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of
              gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific

              lineage-specification by launching an enhancer-primed
              differentiation program and direct activation of CEBPE

              periodontal disease, but the underlying susceptibility pathways
              are not fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms are malleable
              regulators of gene function that can change in response to
              genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential
              mechanism for mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of
              this study is to identify epigenetic changes across tissues that
              are associated with periodontal disease. METHODS: Self-reported
              gingival bleeding and history of gum disease, or tooth mobility,
              were used as indicators of periodontal disease. DNA methylation
              profiles were generated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450
              BeadChip in whole blood, buccal, and adipose tissue samples from
              predominantly older female twins (mean age 58) from the TwinsUK
              cohort. Epigenome-wide association scans (EWAS) of gingival
              bleeding and tooth mobility were conducted in whole blood in 528
              and 492 twins, respectively. Subsequently, targeted candidate
              gene analysis at 28 genomic regions was carried out testing for
              phenotype-methylation associations in 41 (tooth mobility) and 43
              (gingival bleeding) buccal, and 501 (tooth mobility) and 556
              (gingival bleeding) adipose DNA samples. RESULTS: Epigenome-wide
              analyses in blood identified one CpG-site (cg21245277 in ZNF804A)
              associated with gingival bleeding (FDR = 0.03, nominal p value =
              7.17e-8) and 58 sites associated with tooth mobility (FDR < 0.05)
              with the top signals in IQCE and XKR6. Epigenetic variation at 28
              candidate regions (247 CpG-sites) for chronic periodontitis
              showed an enrichment for association with periodontal traits, and
              signals in eight genes (VDR, IL6ST, TMCO6, IL1RN, CD44, IL1B,
              WHAMM, and CXCL1) were significant in both traits. The
              methylation-phenotype association signals validated in buccal
              samples, and a subset (25\%) also validated in adipose tissue.
              CONCLUSIONS: Epigenome-wide analyses in adult female twins
              identified specific DNA methylation changes linked to
              self-reported periodontal disease. Future work will explore the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Age-associated DNA methylation changes provide a
              promising biomarker for the aging process. While genome-wide DNA
              methylation profiles enable robust age-predictors by integration
              of many age-associated CG dinucleotides (CpGs), there are various
              alternative approaches for targeted measurements at specific CpGs
              that better support standardized and cost-effective
              high-throughput analysis. RESULTS: In this study, we utilized
              4647 Illumina BeadChip profiles of blood to select CpG sites that
              facilitate reliable age-predictions based on pyrosequencing. We
              demonstrate that the precision of DNA methylation measurements
              can be further increased with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In
              comparison, bisulfite barcoded amplicon sequencing (BBA-seq) gave
              slightly lower correlation between chronological age and DNA
              methylation at individual CpGs, while the age-predictions were
              overall relatively accurate. Furthermore, BBA-seq data revealed
              that the correlation of methylation levels with age at
              neighboring CpG sites follows a bell-shaped curve, often
              associated with a CTCF binding site. We demonstrate that within
              individual BBA-seq reads the DNA methylation at neighboring CpGs
              is not coherently modified, but reveals a stochastic pattern.
              Based on this, we have developed a new approach for epigenetic
              age predictions based on the binary sequel of methylated and
              non-methylated sites in individual reads, which reflects
              heterogeneity in epigenetic aging within a sample. CONCLUSION:
              Targeted DNA methylation analysis at few age-associated CpGs by
              pyrosequencing, BBA-seq, and particularly ddPCR enables high
              precision of epigenetic age-predictions. Furthermore, we
              demonstrate that the stochastic evolution of age-associated DNA
              methylation patterns in BBA-seq data enables epigenetic clocks
              for individual DNA strands.",

              of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate
              for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of
              composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture
              differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs

              develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that
              strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions

              chronological age, is associated with increased activation of
              pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased
              activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage

              Identical twin pairs discordant for birth weight provide an
              extraordinary model for investigating the association between
              birth weight and adult life health while controlling for not only
              genetics but also postnatal rearing environment. We performed an
              epigenome-wide profiling on blood samples from 150 pairs of adult
              monozygotic twins discordant for birth weight to look for
              molecular evidence of epigenetic signatures in association with
              birth weight discordance. RESULTS: Our association analysis
              revealed no CpG site with genome-wide statistical significance
              (FDR < 0.05) for either qualitative (larger or smaller) or
              quantitative discordance in birth weight. Even with selected
              samples of extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs, no
              significant site was found except for 3 CpGs that displayed
              age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation with FDRs 0.014
              (cg26856578, p = 3.42e-08), 0.0256 (cg15122603, p = 1.25e-07) and
              0.0258 (cg16636641, p = 2.05e-07). Among the three sites,
              intra-pair differential methylation increased with age for

              either the whole samples or the extremely discordant twins.
              CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling did not reveal
              epigenetic signatures of birth weight discordance although some

              annotation of variants is typically inferred by post hoc

              feature in a cell type. Up to 61 regulatory SNPs, called dSNPs,

              oncogene. Expression of CEBPB was repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL cells
              and reinduced by imatinib (STI571) via a mechanism that appears
              to depend on expression of the CUG-repeat RNA-binding protein
              CUGBP1 and the integrity of the CUG-rich intercistronic region of
              c/ebpbeta mRNA. Constitutive expression or conditional activation
              of wild-type CEBPB induced differentiation and inhibited
              proliferation of 32D-BCR/ABL cells in vitro and in mice, but a
              DNA binding-deficient CEBPB mutant had no effect. The
              proliferation-inhibitory effect of CEBPB was, in part, mediated
              by the CEBPB-induced GADD45A gene. Because expression of CEBPB
              (and CEBPA) is low in the blast crisis (BC) stage of chronic
              myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is inversely correlated with
              BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase levels, these findings point to the
              therapeutic potential of restoring C/EBP activity in CML-BC and,
              perhaps, other types of acute leukemia.",

              high-throughput measurement technology over the next several
              years. RESULTS: Here we describe a suite of computational tools
              that incorporate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the
              analysis of DNAm data. The software is structured to easily adapt
              to future versions of the technology. We include methods for
              preprocessing, quality assessment and detection of differentially
              methylated regions from the kilobase to the megabase scale. We
              show how our software provides a powerful and flexible
              development platform for future methods. We also illustrate how
              our methods empower the technology to make discoveries previously

              HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is widely used to quantify DNA
              methylation; nevertheless, the design of an appropriate analysis
              pipeline faces severe challenges due to the convolution of
              biological and technical variability and the presence of a signal
              bias between Infinium I and II probe design types. Despite recent
              attempts to investigate how to analyze DNA methylation data with
              such an array design, it has not been possible to perform a
              comprehensive comparison between different bioinformatics
              pipelines due to the lack of appropriate data sets having both
              large sample size and sufficient number of technical replicates.
              Here we perform such a comparative analysis, targeting the
              problems of reducing the technical variability, eliminating the
              probe design bias and reducing the batch effect by exploiting two
              unpublished data sets, which included technical replicates and
              were profiled for DNA methylation either on peripheral blood,
              monocytes or muscle biopsies. We evaluated the performance of
              different analysis pipelines and demonstrated that: (1) it is
              critical to correct for the probe design type, since the
              amplitude of the measured methylation change depends on the
              underlying chemistry; (2) the effect of different normalization
              schemes is mixed, and the most effective method in our hands were
              quantile normalization and Beta Mixture Quantile dilation (BMIQ);
              (3) it is beneficial to correct for batch effects. In conclusion,
              our comparative analysis using a comprehensive data set suggests

              composition of leukocytes beyond what is possible by simple
              histological or flow cytometric assessments. The latter is
              restricted by the labile nature of protein epitopes, requirements
              for cell processing, and timely cell analysis. In a diverse array
              of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures,
              leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying
              immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging
              research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for
              cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral
              blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls. RESULTS:
              Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for
              inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells
              between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using
              DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously
              obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from
              purified leukocyte samples. We validate the fundamental idea in a

              results consistent with prior biological findings, thereby

  abstract = "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an established risk factor for a
              wide range of vascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS).
              Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood
              glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure
              of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for
              diabetes (HbA1c levels $\geq$ 6.5\%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such
              as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and
              with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM.
              Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms
              mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures.
              Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated
              with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in
              whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina
              HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to measure DNA
              methylation in CpG sites. All statistical analyses were adjusted
              for sex, age, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), smoking
              habit and cell count. Findings were replicated in two independent
              cohorts, an IS cohort and a population-based cohort, using the
              same array. In the discovery phase (N = 355), we identified a CpG
              site, cg19693031 (located in the TXNIP gene) that was associated
              with DM (P = 1.17 $\times$ 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in
              two independent cohorts (N = 167 and N = 645). Methylation of
              TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P
              = 7.3 $\times$ 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic
              patients with poor control of glucose levels. We identified an
              association between the TXNIP gene and DM through epigenetic
              mechanisms, related to sustained hyperglycemia levels (HbA1c
              $\geq$ 7\%).",

               epigenetic clocks, have been created in recent years, with the
               vast majority based on regularized linear regression. This study
               explores the improvement in the performance and interpretation
               of epigenetic clocks using deep learning. First, we gathered 142
               publicly available data sets from several human tissues to
               develop AltumAge, a neural network framework that is a highly
               accurate and precise age predictor. Compared to ElasticNet,
               AltumAge performs better for within-data set and cross-data set
               age prediction, being particularly more generalizable in older
               ages and new tissue types. We then used deep learning
               interpretation methods to learn which methylation sites
               contributed to the final model predictions. We observe that
               while most important CpG sites are linearly related to age, some
               highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the relevance of such
               relationships. Using chromatin annotations, we show that the CpG
               sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions
               were related to gene regulatory regions in the genome, including
               proximity to CTCF binding sites. We also found age-related KEGG
               pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. Lastly, we
               performed downstream analyses of AltumAge to explore its
               applicability and compare its age acceleration with Horvath's
               2013 model. We show that our neural network approach predicts
               higher age acceleration for tumors, for cells that exhibit
               age-related changes in vitro, such as immune and mitochondrial
               dysfunction, and for samples from patients with multiple
               sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and HIV, among other conditions.
               Altogether, our neural network approach provides significant
               improvement and flexibility compared to current epigenetic
               clocks for both performance and model interpretability.",

              web-based search and download interface. Second, the same

              provenance of the data and justify its interpretation in
              biological terms. Since its initial release in 2013 and in
              response to recommendations from consortium members and the wider
              community of scientists who use the Portal to access ENCODE data,
              the Portal has been regularly updated to better reflect these

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Several articles suggest that DNA methylation levels
              in blood relate to Parkinson's disease (PD) but there is a need
              for a large-scale study that involves suitable population based
              controls. The purposes of the study were: (1) to study whether PD
              status is associated with DNA methylation levels in blood/saliva;
              (2) to study whether observed associations relate to blood cell
              types; and (3) to characterize genome-wide significant markers
              (``CpGs'') and clusters of CpGs (co-methylation modules) in terms
              of biological pathways. METHODS: In a population-based case
              control study of PD, we studied blood samples from 335 PD cases
              and 237 controls and saliva samples from another 128 cases and
              131 controls. DNA methylation data were generated from over
              486,000 CpGs using the Illumina Infinium array. We identified
              modules of CpGs (clusters) using weighted correlation network
              analysis (WGCNA). RESULTS: Our cross-sectional analysis of blood
              identified 82 genome-wide significant CpGs (including cg02489202
              in LARS2 p = 8.3 $\times$ 10-11 and cg04772575 in ABCB9 p = 4.3
              $\times$ 10-10). Three out of six PD related co-methylation
              modules in blood were significantly enriched with immune system
              related genes. Our analysis of saliva identified five significant
              CpGs. PD-related CpGs are located near genes that relate to
              mitochondrial function, neuronal projection, cytoskeleton
              organization, systemic immune response, and iron handling.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that: (1) PD status has a
              profound association with DNA methylation levels in blood and
              saliva; and (2) the most significant PD-related changes reflect
              changes in blood cell composition. Overall, this study highlights
              the role of the immune system in PD etiology but future research
              will need to address the causal structure of these relationships.",

  abstract = "In multiple studies DNA methylation has proven to be an accurate
              biomarker of age. To develop these biomarkers, the methylation of
              multiple CpG sites is typically linearly combined to predict
              chronological age. By contrast, in this study we apply the
              Universal PaceMaker (UPM) model to investigate changes in DNA
              methylation during aging. The UPM was initially developed to
              study rate acceleration/deceleration in sequence evolution.
              Rather than identifying which linear combinations of sites
              predicts age, the UPM models the rates of change of multiple CpG
              sites, as well as their starting methylation levels, and
              estimates the age of each individual to optimize the model fit.
              We refer to the estimated age as the ``epigenetic age'', which is
              in contrast to the known chronological age of each individual. We
              construct a statistical framework and devise an algorithm to
              determine whether a genomic pacemaker is in effect (i.e rates of
              change vary with age). The decision is made by comparing two
              competing likelihood based models, the molecular clock (MC) and
              UPM. For the molecular clock model, we use the known
              chronological age of each individual and fit the methylation
              rates at multiple sites, and express the problem as a linear
              least squares and solve it in polynomial time. For the UPM case,
              the search space is larger as we are fitting both the epigenetic
              age of each individual as well as the rates for each site, yet we
              succeed to reduce the problem to the space of individuals and
              polynomial in the more significant space-the methylated sites. We
              first tested our algorithm on simulated data to elucidate the
              factors affecting the identification of the pacemaker model. We
              find that, provided with enough data, our algorithm is capable of
              identifying a pacemaker even when a weak signal is present in the
              data. Based on these results, we applied our method to DNA
              methylation data from human blood from individuals of various
              ages. Although the improvement in variance across sites between
              the UPM and MC was small, the results suggest that the existence
              of a pacemaker is highly significant. The PaceMaker results also
              suggest a decay in the rate of change in DNA methylation with
              age.",

              age and chronological age ($\Delta$age) was calculated in four

              proportional hazards models from the four cohorts was used to
              determine the association between $\Delta$age and mortality. A

              and females. DNA methylation differences have been shown to be
              associated with both age and sex. Here, we investigate age-by-sex
              differences in blood-based DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort
              of 2586 individuals between the ages of 18 and 87 years, with
              replication in a further 4450 individuals between the ages of 18
              and 93 years. METHODS: Linear regression models were applied,
              with stringent genome-wide significance thresholds (p < 3.6
              $\times$ 10) used in both the discovery and replication data. A
              second, highly conservative mixed linear model method that better
              controls the false-positive rate was also applied, using the same
              genome-wide significance thresholds. RESULTS: Using the linear
              regression method, 52 autosomal and 597 X-linked CpG sites,
              mapping to 251 unique genes, replicated with concordant effect
              size directions in the age-by-sex interaction analysis. The site
              with the greatest difference mapped to GAGE10, an X-linked gene.
              Here, DNA methylation levels remained stable across the male
              adult age range (DNA methylation by age r = 0.02) but decreased
              across female adult age range (DNA methylation by age r = -
              0.61). One site (cg23722529) with a significant age-by-sex

              Thus, in aged human muscle, elevated responsiveness of the STAT3

              patients throughout a comprehensive (epi)genetic analysis. One
              hundred and fifteen LLS patients harboring MMR-deficient tumors
              and no germline MMR mutations were included. Mutational analysis
              of 26 colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated genes was performed.
              Pathogenicity of MMR variants was assessed by splicing and
              multifactorial likelihood analyses. Genome-wide methylome
              analysis was performed by the Infinium Human Methylation 450K

  abstract  = "Muscle stem (satellite) cells are relatively resistant to
               cell-autonomous aging. Instead, their endogenous signaling
               profile and regenerative capacity is strongly influenced by the
               aged P-Smad3, differentiated niche, and by the aged circulation.
               With respect to muscle fibers, we previously established that a
               shift from active Notch to excessive transforming growth
               factor-beta (TGF-beta) induces CDK inhibitors in satellite
               cells, thereby interfering with productive myogenic responses.
               In contrast, the systemic inhibitor of muscle repair, elevated
               in old sera, was suggested to be Wnt. Here, we examined the
               age-dependent myogenic activity of sera TGF-beta1, and its
               potential cross-talk with systemic Wnt. We found that sera
               TGF-beta1 becomes elevated within aged humans and mice, while
               systemic Wnt remained undetectable in these species. Wnt also
               failed to inhibit satellite cell myogenicity, while TGF-beta1
               suppressed regenerative potential in a biphasic fashion.
               Intriguingly, young levels of TGF-beta1 were inhibitory and
               young sera suppressed myogenesis if TGF-beta1 was activated. Our
               data suggest that platelet-derived sera TGF-beta1 levels, or
               endocrine TGF-beta1 levels, do not explain the age-dependent
               inhibition of muscle regeneration by this cytokine. In vivo,
               TGF-beta neutralizing antibody, or a soluble decoy, failed to
               reduce systemic TGF-beta1 and rescue myogenesis in old mice.
               However, muscle regeneration was improved by the systemic
               delivery of a TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibitor, which
               attenuated TGF-beta signaling in skeletal muscle. Summarily,
               these findings argue against the endocrine path of a
               TGF-beta1-dependent block on muscle regeneration, identify
               physiological modalities of age-imposed changes in TGF-beta1,
               and introduce new therapeutic strategies for the broad

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is widely used as a biomarker in
              crucial medical applications as well as for human age prediction
              of very high accuracy. This biomarker is based on the methylation
              status of several hundred CpG sites. In a recent line of
              publications we have adapted a versatile concept from
              evolutionary biology - the Universal Pacemaker (UPM) - to the
              setting of epigenetic aging and denoted it the Epigenetic
              PaceMaker (EPM). The EPM, as opposed to other epigenetic clocks,
              is not confined to specific pattern of aging, and the epigenetic
              age of the individual is inferred independently of other
              individuals. This allows an explicit modeling of aging trends, in
              particular non linear relationship between chronological and
              epigenetic age. In one of these recent works, we have presented
              an algorithmic improvement based on a two-step conditional
              expectation maximization (CEM) algorithm to arrive at a critical
              point on the likelihood surface. The algorithm alternates between
              a time step and a site step while advancing on the likelihood
              surface. RESULTS: Here we introduce non trivial improvements to
              these steps that are essential for analyzing data sets of
              realistic magnitude in a manageable time and space. These
              structural improvements are based on insights from linear algebra
              and symbolic algebra tools, providing us greater understanding of
              the degeneracy of the complex problem space. This understanding
              in turn, leads to the complete elimination of the bottleneck of
              cumbersome matrix multiplication and inversion, yielding a fast
              closed form solution in both steps of the CEM.In the experimental
              results part, we compare the CEM algorithm over several data sets
              and demonstrate the speedup obtained by the closed form
              solutions. Our results support the theoretical analysis of this
              improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These improvements enable us to
              increase substantially the scale of inputs analyzed by the
              method, allowing us to apply the new approach to data sets that
              could not be analyzed before.",

              single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified in genome-wide
              association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
              most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific
              community. Recent evidence points to the epigenetic and chromatin
              states of the genome as having important roles. METHODS: We
              genotyped 355 healthy young individuals for 52 known
              obesity-associated SNPs and obtained DNA methylation levels in
              their blood using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip. Associations
              between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine residues
              were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight
              category, and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication
              in other tissues, we used two open-access datasets (skin
              fibroblasts, n = 62; four brain regions, n = 121-133) and an
              additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n = 149).
              RESULTS: We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated
              SNPs associate with methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites.
              Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene promoters, including
              genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
              NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10,

              SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
              that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood
              mononuclear cells. Finally, our results indicate that some of
              these associations are not blood-specific as we successfully
              replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs
              are associated with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected
              by association of obesity risk allele genotypes with differential

              hypo- or hypermethylated. Hypermethylated sites are
              overrepresented among genes that are involved in DNA binding,
              transcription regulation, processes of anatomical structure and
              developmental process and cortex neuron differentiation (P-value
              down to P = 9.14*10(-67)). By contrast, hypomethylated sites are
              not strongly overrepresented among any biological function or
              process. Our results indicate that the 23\% of the variation in
              DNA methylation is attributed chronological age, and that
              hypermethylation is more site-specific than hypomethylation. It
              appears that the change in DNA methylation partly overlap with
              regions that change histone modifications with age, indicating an
              interaction between the two major epigenetic mechanisms.
              Epigenetic modifications and change in gene expression over time

              of transcriptional regulatory motifs has moved more slowly. To
              understand how distinct expression profiles can be established
              and maintained, a greater understanding of these sequences and
              their trans-acting factors is required. Herein we have used a

              sites [repressor element 1/neuron-restrictive silencer element
              (RE1/NRSE)] and potential target genes of RE1 silencing
              transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencing factor

              We have used this genome-wide analysis to identify 1,892 human,
              1,894 mouse, and 554 Fugu RE1/NRSEs and present their location
              and gene linkages in a searchable database. Furthermore, we
              identified an in vivo hierarchy in which distinct subsets of
              RE1/NRSEs interact with endogenous levels of REST/NRSF, whereas
              others function as bona fide transcriptional control elements
              only in the presence of elevated levels of REST/NRSF. These data
