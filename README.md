# Multi-State Epigenetic Pacemaker Manuscript

This repository contains the analysis code to reproduce the results for the manuscript *The Multi-State Epigenetic Pacemaker enables the 
identification of combinations of factors that influence DNA methylation*. 

The repository is organized as follows:
- [DataProcessing](DataProcessing)
  - Contains the code to process the raw data and generate the input files for the analysis.
- [MethylationAnalysisHelpers](MethylationAnalysisHelpers)
  - Contains the code to load data and produce standardized figures.
- [Analysis](Analysis)
  - Contains the code to perform the analysis and generate the figures.
- [Paper](Paper)
  - Contains the manuscript file and the figures.
