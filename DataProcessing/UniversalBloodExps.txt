27. Continuous Aging of the Human DNA Methylome Throughout the Human Lifespan
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation plays an important role in development of disease and the process of aging. In this study we examine DNA methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging in age from 14 to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third (29%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value <0.05), of which 60.5% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5% hypermethylated with increasing age. more...

50. Epigenetic findings in periodontitis in UK twins: a cross sectional study
(Submitter supplied) Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to periodontal disease, but the underlying susceptibility pathways are not fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms are malleable regulators of gene function that can change in response to genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential mechanism mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of this study is to identify epigenetic changes across tissues that are associated with periodontal disease.

75. Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes at proximal promoters and enhancers
(Submitter supplied) Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. more...

98. Age-related profiling of DNA methylation in CD8+ T cells reveals changes in immune response and transcriptional regulator genes
(Submitter supplied) Human ageing affects the immune system resulting in an overall decline in immunocompetence. Although all immune cells are affected during aging, the functional capacity of T cells is most influenced and is linked to decreased responsiveness to infections and impaired differentiation. We studied age-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from younger and older individuals. more...

139. CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes: Gene-specific DNA methylation signatures
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as mechanism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7LOF) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2DLOF), respectively. We expected that epigenetically driven developmental pathways regulated by CHD7 and KMT2D would overlap and that DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations downstream of the mutations in these genes would identify common target genes, elucidating a mechanistic link between these conditions, as well as specific target genes for each. more...
